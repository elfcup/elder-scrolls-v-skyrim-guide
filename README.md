# project1-skyrim

Project done with partner Earl Clarin. It is a short guide to the video game Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. 

You can click on the character choices and be given images of what your characters can look like, names that are in line with the race's culture, and a short description about the combination chosen. You can also type in key words and be given relevant links on wikipedia and images related to your key word. Below this, you will see a map with important regions and locations listed on the side, with links to click for more information. 
We made use of many front end technologies, as well as Firebase.
